# 🚀 BPB-Wizard

This repository is a fork of [BPB Wizard](https://github.com/bia-pain-bache/BPB-Wizard), cross-compiled for multi-platform support.

🔗 [BPB Panel](https://github.com/bia-pain-bache/BPB-Worker-Panel) and [BPB Wizard](https://github.com/bia-pain-bache/BPB-Wizard) were originally created by [bia-pain-bache](https://github.com/bia-pain-bache). In appreciation of these brilliant ideas, I’ve simply refactored BPB Wizard using the native Cloudflare SDK and enabled multi-platform compilation.

⭐ If you find this project useful, don’t forget to star the [original repository](https://github.com/bia-pain-bache/BPB-Wizard)—that’s where the real magic happens! ✨
